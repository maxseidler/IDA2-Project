# Breast cancer classification with the Breast Histopathology Images dataset
This directory's data folder should contain the data only locally (too large to upload to GitHub). See `data/content.txt` for details.

## Data
We use the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) platform. The original files are located [here](http://gleason.case.edu/webdata/jpi-dl-tutorial/IDC_regular_ps50_idx5.zip)
